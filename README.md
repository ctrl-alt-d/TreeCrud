# Blazor Tree CRUD

>DISCLAIMER: This code is almost 1 year old and it is not maintained.

A simple Server-Side Blazor CRUD app to deal with hierarchical data.

Project has a data layer with GraphQL for R (Retrieve) and classical Rest for CUD (Create Update Delete)

The basic functionality is ready:

* Unexpand nodes and expand nodes with Lazy load.
* Select and unselect a node.
* Insert new nodes
* ToDo: Update, Delete

### Can I use `UITreeComponent` on my project?

Use it as your risk. Steps:

* Download the project.
* Add a reference to it from your own project.
* Add the following line in your `_ViewImports.cshtml`:  `@addTagHelper *, BlazorTreeControl` 
* Please, PR your improvements and Issue for comments.

Don't hesitate to contact me for further information :)
